    - WolframAlpha
        - Uses tables generated by tableToAscii
    - Ping
        - Rounded to 3 decimal places

    - List helper class, maybe one day we'll [stop sinning](https://twitter.com/MindfulMinun/status/1010001324958732288?s=20). (Line 90 onwards of main.coffee)

# [Release v3.0.0](https://github.com/MindfulMinun/discord-haruka/releases/tag/v3.0.0)
**Note:** The three probably doesn't mean anything to you.

### Additions & Changes
- New: WolframAlpha
    - Query the world's information with Haruka's `-h wa` function!
- Smash
    - Now denotes whether a character is DLC or not.
    - Updated help data
    - Added Hero and Banjo-Kazooie metadata.
- Ping
    - Now shows 3 numbers, WebSocket ping, Reaction time, and Delivery. This may be more confusing but I digress.
- Dev
    - Added `fetch` helper function
    - Switching from `config.json` to `.env`
        - This is a breaking change, which constitutes bumping the major version number.

### Bug fixes
- Help
    - Help would refuse to show the detailed help list when asked to. I'm still not sure why, but this has been fixed.
- Smash
    - Smash uses the FrannHammer API for determining whether frame data was available. [The endpoint has since changed](https://github.com/Frannsoft/FrannHammer/wiki/v0.7.0-Update).

# [Release v2.1.1](https://github.com/MindfulMinun/discord-haruka/releases/tag/v2.1.1)

### Some bug fixes
- Pok√©mon
    - Now treats leading zeroes as expected (`-h pkmn 001` brings up Bulbasaur)
- Smash
    - Hotfix: Do not search by series. This fixes a problem when searching for "palutena", which is codename for the Kid Icarus series, bringing up Pit instead of Palutena as expected.
    - Short help aligned properly. I sincerely apologize for triggering anyone's OCD.
- Version
    - Added relative time. Tells you how long ago Haruka was started.

- Main:
    - Updated the fallback function to disregard the empty string, since Help's RegExp accounts for that.
- Pok√©mon

- Say
    - Dead simple: just disableEveryone. No need for role management.
- Someone
    - Only allowed to use `-h someone` if the user is allowed to mention `@everyone`.
